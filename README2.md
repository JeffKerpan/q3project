## Drink Water

DESCRIPTION:
Drink Water is a mobile app that aims to solve a simple but important issue, staying hydrated. Far too often people find themselves with many health issues attributed to dehydration. They also often don't see the connection between many things that hydration takes care of automatically. Our app allows the user to log their daily water intake and be reminded them at certain times to drink water if they have not reported it on the app. This simple tool will hopefully encourage its users to have good habits for staying hydrated.
